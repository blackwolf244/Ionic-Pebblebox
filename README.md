##### Web2 Projekt
## THD Pebbles:

A simple Application displaying a Dashboard that represents open API's with the inclusion of Weather and Maps via [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) respectively.

So why Pebbles? Basically it should be easily expandable. just throw in your Ideas on what to add next, throw your Pebble into this wonderful information Pond, and vote on which Pebble should be worked on next!

This should allow a easy overview for your day at the THD.

## Requirements:

Client-Server-Application with Front- and Backend:

> The Frontend will be based upon a Dashboard that allows interactions with different API's, while using a self defined API to determine weekly Dinner votes based upon the openmensa.org API and allow Voting for the next Pebble Idea.

Input of form-data in the frontend

> Forms will be Apparent at several Locations. For Location Input, Dinner-votes, Pebble Creation and Voting and maybe even a simple open Forum.

Usage of a REST API (static like openmensa.org)

> Open-Mensa is going to get used to determine the Possible Upvotes or Downvotes on the current Menu.

Usage of dynamic data from a sensor (probably create an own REST API?)

> For dynamic Data I'll choose a little 

Usage of OpenStreetMap

> As I'm using OpenWeatherMap and OpenMensa the inclusion of OpenStreetMap is used to display Locations for both of them.
